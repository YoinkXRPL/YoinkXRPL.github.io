        <h3>HODL Power</h3>
        <container class="text-center">
        <p>HODL Power has always been present in the Yoinking mechanism, but hidden behind the scenes, it is now visible in the YOINKING tweet. The higher your $YOINK holdings the more likely you are to become the YOINKER.<br>
        This is based on the square root of your holdings, see below for some example maths on this one.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Using the Square root of holdings is a simple way to ensure that it is non-linear, but still weighted more towards those that hold more.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Trade Power</h3>
    <container class="text-center">
    <p>This is a new mechanism recently introduced and will gamify both $YOINK & $YEET on a new level. It will make $YOINK act like it has a community powered Market Maker, and make trading $YEET more enticing, which will further increase volume once the AMM arrives on the XRPL.</p>

    <h6 class="text-left">How does it work?</h6>
    <p>Any time a wallet positively increases their $YOINK OR $YEET position via trading, that is 1:1 added to their Trade Power</p>
    <p>If you create a limit order to Buy $YOINK (or $YEET) and someone else fulfills it, the amount fulfilled will be added to your trading power.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if you market buy $YOINK or $YEET, this will add the amount purchased to your trading power.</p>
        <p>These additions to your trading power only last until the <strong >NEXT</strong> YOINKING, after which everyone's trade power will be reset to 0, unless they trade before the following YOINKING</p>
        
    </container><h3>Combining the Power</h3>
    <container class="text-center">
    
    <p>Your HODL & Trade Power are combined together to create your "Weighted Chance" to become the yoinker.</p>
    <p>As an example, say you have 500 $YOINK, and you purchase another 500, your HODL power, would be the square root of 1000 $YOINK: 31.622. Your trade power would be 500!<br> Combining them for a total of 531.622<br>
    By purchasing 500 $YOINK, you would have more than 10x greater chance to be picked, than someone purely holding 1000 $YOINK.</p>
