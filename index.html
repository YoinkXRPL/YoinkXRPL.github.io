        <h3>The YOINK Game</h3>
        <p class="text-center">
            As a meme token, we have designed a fun and engaging way to utilize the Clawback Amendment<br>
            Once an hour, a Yoinking commences following these rules:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Anyone holding less than 1 $YOINK & more than 0, will have their $YOINK clawed-back (YOINK!) This is permanently removed from supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                    33 Wallets will have 1 $YOINK yoinked from their holdings (GET YOINKED!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    One lucky holder will receive 33% of Yoinked Holdings!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Team & Community wallets share 33% of Yoinked Holdings!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The remainder (34%) is permanently removed from the supply!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p class="text-center">We have had many community questions about open sourcing our tools & the Yoinking code.<br>
        We will be doing this in parts, first showing how clawback works, and then releasing the Yoinking code in full when it has reached its final stages (post $YEET launch)</p>

        <h1>YOINK & YEET</h1>

        <h3>$YEET Token</h3>

        <p class="text-center">
            YEET is the sister token to YOINK. It does what YOINK cannot, but those who YEET to hard, may be YOINKED!

        <p class="text-center">
            <ul><li> Initially 300,000 $YEET was issued, 90% of YOINK. 
                <li>YEET can only be obtained via the DEX, permanent offers will allow $YOINK holders to swap $YOINK for $YEET at .90 Exchange rate.</li>  
        <li>This means you could sell 10 $YOINK and you would receive minimum 9 $YEET. Permanently forever.</li>  
        <li>There is also a permanent offer in the opposite direction Sell 10 $YEET, receive 9 $YOINK.      </li>  
    </ul>    
        </p>
        <p>
           Through these permanent offers, both YEET & YOINK will slowly deflate in circulating supply. The excess will sit in the

        <h3>Why would I YEET?</h3>
        <p class="text-center">
            Why wouldn't you? <br>
            <ul><li>
            YEET does not have clawback set - it's a safe place to hide some $YOINK</li>
            <li>Because YEET does not have Clawback set, it will be posible to use YEET in the upcoming AMM Amendment</li>
            <li>Holding Less YEET thank YOINK, but more YEET than 0 decreases your chances to be YOINKED!</li>
            <li>The above reasons and more, will present interesting arbitrage opportunities in future</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>YEET/YOINK Ratio</h3>
        <p class="text-center">
            It is important that one does not over YEET themselves, as such we have added some additional rules that affect the YOINK game.<br>
            If you hold less YEET thank YOINK, (but more than 0) you have less chance of being YOINKED than someone with only YOINK.<br>
            BUT, if you hold more YEET thank YOINK (and more than 0 YOINK), you have MORE chance of being YOINKED. 
            
        </p>

        <p>Each YOINK holder, is given a "weighted chance" to be picked.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hold only YOINK, your Weighted chance is 1</li>
            <li>Hold More YOINK thank YEET your weighted chance is LESS than 1
               <ul> <li>This is calculated as 1-((YEET/YOINK)*(YEET+YOINK)*0.000015)</li></ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Hold More YEET thank YOINK your weighted chance is MORE than 1
                <ul> <li>This is calculated as 1+((YEET/YOINK)*(YEET+YOINK)*0.000015)</li></ul>
             </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Ratio Examples</h6>
        <span>As you can see below, the closer the ratio of YOINK:YEET the better your weighted chance is, favouring having Equal, or slighly more YOINK.</span>
