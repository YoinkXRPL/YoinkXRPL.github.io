        <h3>Token Basics</h3>

        <p class="text-center">
            Initially <span class="bold">333,333</span> $YOINK was issued on the XRPL. This was airdropped to those who set the Trustline, by the deadline and distributed based on $XRP holdings.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center ">
            Clawback is set on $YOINK, as per the XRPL ammendment: <a href="https://xrpl.org/clawback.html" target="_blank">https://xrpl.org/clawback.html</a><br>
            This means as the issuer, we are able to retrieve tokens from user wallets, YOINK!
        </p>

        <h3>The YOINK Game</h3>
        <p class="text-center">
            As a meme token, we have designed a fun and engaging way to utilize the Clawback Amendment<br>
            Once an hour, a Yoinking commences following these rules:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Anyone holding less than 1 $YOINK & more than 0, will have their $YOINK clawed-back (YOINK!) This is permanently removed from supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                    33 Wallets will have 1 $YOINK yoinked from their holdings (GET YOINKED!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    One lucky holder will receive 33% of Yoinked Holdings!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Team & Community wallets share 33% of Yoinked Holdings!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The remainder (34%) is permanently removed from the supply!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
